# Calorie Crusher

Calorie Crusher is a fun, food based, dodging game developed by team 313Devs in the MSU Apple Developer Academy for Challenge 5. Calorie Crusher is available on [Testflight]("https://testflight.apple.com/join/X2YKak6f") now!  
## Background

- According To The CDC, Approximately 1 In 5 U.S Children And Adolescents Have Obesity.

- According To The NLM Only 6.4% Of Video Games Produced Over Several Decades Have Been Focused On Nutritional Education.

So when the MSU Apple Developer Academy gave my team and I a challenge to make a game after a lot of brainstorming we believed that we can do something fun as well as educational. Calorie Crusher not only gives it's players a fun dodging game to enjoy but it also teaches them about health and nutrition along the way.
## Lessons Learned

Overall I learned SpriteKit for the very first time and the process of Game Developement.
## Acknowledgements

My thanks goes to my team (listed below) this entire challenge and game wouldn't have been a success without you guy's hardwork and dedication to it. We all worked together and created something awesome all as first time developers.
